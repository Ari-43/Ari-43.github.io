		Ari43 (AKA Ari RERA 43)'s personal website. Currently a heavy WIP. <br>
		Source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Ari-43/ari-43.github.io" target="_blank">https://github.com/Ari-43/ari-43.github.io</a> but don't expect it to be perfect. I'm somewhat of an HTML newbie.

		My current website is <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/arirera43/home" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/arirera43/home</a> but has out of date information. This website is intended to replace it.
